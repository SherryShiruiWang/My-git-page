# Colour Simulator

This folder contains images of the graphs in the product notebook that have been run through the colour blindness simulator found here: https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/

The purpose is to account for readers who are colour blind or colour sensitive by chosing the right colours as well as adding extra features such as interactive hover features of the plots. 

These images are accessed through the process notebook and are made available here so when this repository is downloaded, it can be run and illustrated within the notebook.
