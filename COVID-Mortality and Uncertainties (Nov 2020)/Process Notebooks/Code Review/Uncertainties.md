| 4.00  | Data engineering and cleaning | Countries variable is also in the cleaning notebook (sorted- need to make the same)  | Sorting to keep consistent order- Sherryâ€™s file  |
| 4.03  | Uncertainties | Visualize infections with uncertainties, plot the estimates using the IHME model. Also- Variable name change  |   |
| 4.04  | Infections graph   | Ipywidget used in our graphing (applies to every graph)  | Variable name change for the models dataset |
| 4.05  | IFR calculation functions  | How did you check those variables? Do we need to justify this  | 1.Show other variables that we would expect to have impact. Also: Correlation graphs to show how we picked the variables (visualise the linear/nonlinear relations)  |
| 4.08  | Bar graphs   | The uncertainties in the bar graph seems to increase as the IFR increases HDI | Explain the increase in uncertainties   |
| Discussion  |   |  Colours codes for countries. Interactivity - will it work when we submit?? | Check country colour codes in the bubble chart  |
