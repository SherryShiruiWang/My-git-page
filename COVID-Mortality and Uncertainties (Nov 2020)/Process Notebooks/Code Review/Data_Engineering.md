| Timestamp (pm)  | Section | Clarification | Improvements |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1.27  | Sherry began presenting her Data Engineering Process Notebook   |   |   |
| 1.28  | Explained the purpose of Ocra function  |   |   |
| 1.29  | Importing of all 6 datasets   | Why did you use the raw data link from github? Using this link arises problems when updating the raw data manually for the models  | Check to see if we can access the raw data without raw link. Also add LSHTM model link and change date format |
| 1.35  | Date format and country subset  | Create variable for country before subsetting  | Less long codes  |
| 1.37  | Total recovered- new recovered   |   |   |
| 1.38  | Data Cleaning- detailing with NA  |   |   |
| 1.41  | Estimation data sets    |   |   |
| 1.45  | Include outlier analysis   |   | Use box plots and discuss how we can deal with it  |
| 1.52  | Functions   | Importing data through functions for other process notebooks  | Check to see if cleaned data can be imported in the other process notebooks using functions  |
| 1.57  | Load data  | “Preserve immutability”  | Discuss for both cases: 1. “Our world in data” and “John Hoppkins”- preserved (raw data straight from source). 2. Other datasets- not preserved as we’d like as the source requires us to download the datasets. |
