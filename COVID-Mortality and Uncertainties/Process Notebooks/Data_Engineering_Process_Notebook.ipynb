Both data sources are updated daily retrieved directlt from the Github link and both datasets includes COVID data for Australia, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa and United States, which is suitable for this notebook's purpose. Note that since these raw data is sourced directly from the Github link that is managed by the two organisations, hence both raw data have been **preserved immutability**.\n",

This is because the models each have a different update frequency approximately every 2 to 3 weeks, hence the data available to us is lagged in the dates. With some models ceased updates since August, this may be due to various reasons. Therefore, in this situation we should not replace the missing values with 0s which could potentially decrease the accuracy or magnifying the uncertainties during the data cleaning stage. We will leave these values untouched so that they are not included in our later calculations of COVID-19's death rate."
