# Introduction 

This folder includes all the process notebooks for our final product notebook.
The group has divided the process into 5 sections including the Data Engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis, Case Fatality Rate, Infection Fatality Rate and the Uncertainties analysis. These process notebooks will be based on the previous work that each member has completed for the 6 different countries.

## What is included in each section?
- Data Engineering

Importing all necesaary data and libraies and complete essential steps of data cleansing and data munging such as dealing with missing values, checking data types and merging, transforming datasets, in preparation for the analysis.
- EDA

For the purpose of gaining more understanding of the datasets, conduct descriptive analysis including minimum, maximum, variances and other visualisations. Visualisations contains time series plots for new cases, deaths, recoveries and testing for the 6 chosen countries. 
- CFR

Exploring the Case Fatality Rates (CFR) for each country and plotting daily CFR against the dates for visualisation and interpreting trends.

- IFR

Select the best model for the estimation of infection cases in each county and calculate the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR). This section will also include graphs comparing across the different estimation models and with the confirmed cases in the county.
- Uncertainties

In this section, the uncertainties are explored. The confidence Interval of the Infection fatality rate for each country is determined and more visualisations of presenting the uncertainties will be explored.

The sections above are assigned as the following:

| Team Member | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
|Sherry| Data engineering|
|Johnson| EDA|
|Hendrix| CFR|
|Charles| IFR|
|Cynthia|Uncertainties|

## Cleaned Dataset Folder 

This folder contains the data used to run the individual process notebooks after the first data engineering one to mitigate cleaning duplicate codes. 

## Code Review

This folder contains: 
* the code review conducted for each team member on their assigned process notebook
* the 5 think-aloud 
* the retrospective
