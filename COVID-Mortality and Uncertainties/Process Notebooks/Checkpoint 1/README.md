# Checkpoint 1

## Introduction
This section contains the process notebooks for each team member for checkpoint 1. In this checkpoint, we performed our individual data exploration to gain an initial understanding of the data. 

## Understanding the Notebooks 

All process notebooks in this section follow a similar trail of analysis. In gaining an understanding of the data, we performed data engineering and exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 in Australia. Different datasets were explored to uncover the differences between each data files and a few visualsations were created to understand the variables and identify potential trends. The Case Fatality Rate value is calculated and compared across the process notebooks from each member, which is highlighting slight difference between each datasets.
