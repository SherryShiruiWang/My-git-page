# Introduction 

The data in this folder contain the models researchers have developed in estimating the number of infection COVID-19 individuals around the world. As the models come from different researchers, they are updated at different times and therefore the data here is downloaded on a weekly basis by the team to ensure the most updated version of the models is being used over the course of the analysis. There is one dataset provided that includes [an overiew of all the models](https://github.sydney.edu.au/swan9801/R13B-Group4-COVID/blob/master/Check%20Point%202/Model%20Datasets/daily-new-estimated-infections-of-covid-19.csv) and the remaining files are specific models for the:  [Imperial College London (ICL)](https://github.sydney.edu.au/swan9801/R13B-Group4-COVID/blob/master/Check%20Point%202/Model%20Datasets/daily-new-estimated-covid-19-infections-icl-model.csv), [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)](https://github.sydney.edu.au/swan9801/R13B-Group4-COVID/blob/master/Check%20Point%202/Model%20Datasets/daily-new-estimated-covid-19-infections-ihme-model.csv), [Youyang Gu (YYG)](https://github.sydney.edu.au/swan9801/R13B-Group4-COVID/blob/master/Check%20Point%202/Model%20Datasets/daily-new-estimated-covid-19-infections-yyg-model.csv) and [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)](https://github.sydney.edu.au/swan9801/R13B-Group4-COVID/blob/master/Check%20Point%202/Model%20Datasets/daily-new-estimated-covid-19-infections-lshtm-mode.csv). The source of these models are found here and contain information on each including what the model is used for and based on and any assumptions and potential limitations.
