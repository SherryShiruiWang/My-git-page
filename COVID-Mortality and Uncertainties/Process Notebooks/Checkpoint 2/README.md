## Introduction
This section contains the process notebooks for each team member for checkpoint 2. In this checkpoint, we performed more in depth individual data exploration towards answering the driving question.

## Understanding the Notebooks 

All process notebooks in this section follow a similar trail of analysis. In gaining an understanding of the data, we performed data engineering and exploratory data analysis on COVID-19 for different countries, including Brazil, Russia, South Africa, India and United States. Each process notebooks explores through visualising the trends in confirmed cases, deaths, testing and recovered cases. Additionally, the Case Fatality Rate is graphed against the dates to observe potential trends and correlations. Lastly, we used new datasets that estimates the infection cases that allows us to calculate the Infection Fatality Rates for each country and discover new findings.
