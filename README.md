# My-git-page
A collection and showcase of some codes and (group/individual) projects completed in University.

Project language involves Python and R Studio.

1. COVID Mortality and Uncertainties Project aims to tackle the driving question: How deadly is COVID-19 and how can we present data about this question so that the uncertainty is made very clear to the user of the visualisation of the results? See COVID Mortality and Uncertainties for more details and instructions to navigate.

2. 'Age of Abalone' project was using different metrics and machine learning techniques (SLR/MLR) to find patterns and predict the age of an abolone using multiple features of abalones in a data set.

See folder Age of Abolone then navigate to 'Executive Summary- R project on 'The Age of Abalone'.pdf' for the report or 'Exec Summary.rmd' for the R studio code for producing the R report.

3. Kidney Rejection/Diabetes Classifier is developed for potential future uses in detecting Kidney Transplant failures in Diabetes patients. 

See folder Kidney Rejection/Diabetes Classifier.
